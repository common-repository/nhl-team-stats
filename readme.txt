NHL Team Stats allows bloggers display an NHL team's standings within their sidebar.

== Description ==

NEW: Our very own Newsfeed has been added to the plugin - you choose whether or not to include it in your blog settings panel!

NHL Team Stats plugin can be added to any blog with a dynamic sidebar. Once installed, the blogger can choose their favorite NHL Team 
and the type of display they want (compact or large). The stats are updated each week of the NHL regular season, so that blog 
visitors can keep track of all the important NHL team standings and stats. Additionally, teams qualifying for post-season play are denoted automatically 
in each stats table with the the standard NHL symbols.

Please note, this plugin is supported by text link advertising. Accordingly, bloggers will see 4 links displayed at the bottom of their 
stats table, which will remain the same once the plugin has been installed. Please do not modify these links - this is how we pay the bills.

Generally speaking, we have no outward preference where our plugin appears, as long as the content of the particular blog is legal in its respective jurisdiction. For example, 
many bloggers like to post sports stats on <a href="http://www.sportsbetting3.com">sports betting</a> websites, which is permissable where legal. Similarly, use of the plugin 
on an <a href="http://www.plazacasinos.com">online casinos</a> website may not be necessarily relevant, but is tolerable if used in an appropriate context. 
This plugin is licensed under WordPress.org guidelines and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">General Public License</a>.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I remove the advertising links? =

No, this is how we pay the bills and keep the server up. Please do not alter the links or link information in your database. If you would like to 
manually change links, please contact the plugin author for assitance.

= Will new features be added? =

Yes, we will make changes to the diplay from time to time. These changes will appear automatically on your blog.

= Why is there so much "inline" CSS displayed in my NHL Stats table? =

We decided to use inline CSS to display the stats table, in order to comply with W3C markup standards as much as possible. The only other alternative 
would be to embed a new stylesheet, however this does not meet W3C standards. Any other ideas from users are welcome!

= My sidebar (or part of my sidebar) disappeared after I installed this plugin, what happened? =

This problem arises from the coding of your WP template. In some cases, the PHP code that calls the blog's sidebar and sidebar objects 
is placed in the wrong spot on the page. In order to remedy this, visit the following link: http://cutline.tubetorial.com/forums/showthread.php?t=8596 . The fix 
takes 5 minutes or less to complete.

= What constitutes inappropriate content? =

This plugin is free to use *ALMOST* anywhere. We would prefer that the plugin be used on personal blogs, business blogs, sports blogs, and the like. Use of this plugin 
on any websites that incite hate, prejudice, violence, terrorism, or any sort intolerance for diversity is discouraged. Can I post on an <a href="http://www.jaxcasinos.com">online casinos</a> 
website? Sure. Can I post on an adult website? Sure - Keep it legal. Can I post on my school's webserver or company webserver? Sure, but check with the appropriate IT people first.

== Changelog ==

= 0.9.9 =
ALL NEW News Feed, with top headlines for NHL fans that update regularly throughout the day. The scroller is very simple: it displays 4 news items which are clickable and open a new browser page to see the actual story. You can 
activate the scroller in your Blog settings control panel for NHL-Team-Stats. Blog users should have Adobe Flash enabled browsers to see the news feed. Also, the use of a Flash feed 
means that there are no coNHLicts with other scripts running on your page, many of which are powered by Javascript.

= 0.9.8 = 
Ad layouts, stats, and text links are now pulled from a remote server, opposed to configured within the plugin script. This will allow for dynamic updates and diminish the need for 
the user to continually upgrade to get new stats functions in their tables.

RSS Stat feed is now larger but contains much less items.

= 0.9.2 =
